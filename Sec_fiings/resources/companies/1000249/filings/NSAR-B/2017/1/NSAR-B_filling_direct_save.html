<DESCRIPTION>FIRST EAGLE VARIABLE FUNDS AUDIT LETTER
<TEXT>
Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders
of First Eagle Overseas Variable Fund:

In planning and performing our audit of the financial
statements of First Eagle Overseas Variable Fund (the
"Fund") as of and for the year ended December 31,
2016, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), we considered the Fund's internal control
over financial reporting, including controls over
safeguarding securities, as a basis for designing our
auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our
opinion on the financial statements and to comply
with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we did not express
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting.

The management of the Fund is responsible for
establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling this
responsibility, estimates and judgments by
management are required to assess the expected
benefits and related costs of controls.  A fund's
internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.  A fund's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the fund; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the fund are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and trustees of the fund; and (3)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
or disposition of a fund's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

A deficiency in internal control over financial
reporting exists when the design or operation of a
control does not allow management or employees, in
the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a
timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or
combination of control deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
the Fund's annual or interim financial statements will
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting was for the limited purpose
described in the first paragraph and would not
necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control
over financial reporting that might be material
weaknesses under standards established by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting and
its operation, including controls for safeguarding
securities that we consider to be material weaknesses
as defined above as of December 31, 2016.

This report is intended solely for the information and
use of management, Board of Trustees, and
Shareholders of First Eagle Overseas Variable Fund
and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is
not intended to be and should not be used by anyone
other than these specified parties.
