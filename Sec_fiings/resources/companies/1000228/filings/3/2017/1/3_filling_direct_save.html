power and authority as hereinafter described on behalf of and in the name, place

any such information to any attorney-in-fact and further approves and ratifies
any such release of information;

		(3)	do and perform any and all acts for and on behalf of the undersigned which
may be necessary or desirable to prepare, complete and execute any such Form 3,

such Forms or reports with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission,

		(4)	take any other action of any type whatsoever in connection with the
foregoing which, in the opinion of such attorney-in-fact, may be of benefit to,
in the best interest of, or legally required by, the undersigned, it being
understood that the documents executed by such attorney-in-fact on behalf of the
undersigned pursuant to this Power of Attorney shall be in such form and shall
contain such terms and conditions as such attorney-in-fact may approve in such
attorney-in-fact's sole discretion.

		The undersigned hereby gives and grants to each such attorney-in-fact full
power and authority to do and perform any and every act and thing whatsoever
requisite, necessary or proper to be done in the exercise of any of the rights
and powers herein granted, as fully to all intents and purposes as the
undersigned might or could do if personally present, with full power of
substitution or revocation, hereby ratifying and confirming all that such
attorney-in-fact, or such attorney-in-fact's substitute or substitutes, shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue of this power of attorney and the
rights and powers herein granted.

		The undersigned hereby acknowledges that (a) the foregoing attorneys-in-fact
are serving in such capacity at the request of the undersigned; (b) this Limited
Power of Attorney authorizes, but does not require, each such attorney-in-fact

attorney-in-fact assumes (i) any liability for the undersigned's responsibility
to comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) any liability of the
undersigned for any failure to comply with such requirements, or (iii) any
obligation or liability of the undersigned for profit disgorgement under Section
16(b) of the Exchange Act; and (e) this Limited Power of Attorney does not
relieve the undersigned from responsibility for compliance with the
undersigned's obligations under the Exchange Act, including, without limitation,
the reporting requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

		This Power of Attorney shall remain in full force and effect until the
undersigned is no longer required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with respect to the
undersigned's holdings of, and transactions in, securities issued by the
Company, unless earlier revoked as to any attorney-in-fact by the undersigned in
a signed writing delivered to such attorney-in-fact.  In affixing his signature
to this Power of Attorney, the undersigned hereby revokes any and all previously
executed Powers of Attorney for the same or similar purposes.

		IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned has caused this Power of Attorney to be
executed as of this 14 day of February, 2017.
